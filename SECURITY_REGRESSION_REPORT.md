# SECURITY REGRESSION REPORT

## Phase 6B-3 Telegram Real Gated Security Status
Date: 2026-05-07

## Security Controls

### Token Handling
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is loaded from environment/config only.
- Real mode refuses startup without token.
- Token is redacted from `TelegramConfig.__repr__`, gateway logs, evidence, and message outputs.
- `.env.example` documents variables without real values.

### Allowlist
- `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` is required for real mode.
- Empty allowlist fails closed in real mode.
- Unauthorized users receive `DENIED`.

### Rate Limiting
- Gateway/operator use per-user rate limiting.
- `TELEGRAM_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` is supported.

### Replay Protection and Approvals
- ApprovalWorkflow creates unique approval IDs.
- ApprovalWorkflow hashes the action payload.
- Approval fails on replayed action hash.
- Approval fails on action hash mismatch.
- R4 requires approval.
- R5 is blocked.

### Sandbox and Evidence
- Mission dispatch goes through `SandboxDispatcher` and `SandboxController`.
- R5 never dispatches.
- EvidenceLogger records incoming message, authorization, policy, approval, mission, and sandbox events with redaction.

### Secret Scan
- No real secrets found.
- Scan output contains expected variable names, code redaction patterns, and historical/test fixtures only.

### Legacy Telegram Scan
- No active `saga_fusion/telegram_mission_operator/` runtime directory.
- No active imports to the legacy path found in `saga_fusion/telegram`.
- Historical reports still mention the removed legacy path for audit traceability.

## Verdict
Security regression status: PASS for Phase 6B-3 gated real Telegram preflight.
